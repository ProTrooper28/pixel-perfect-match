 *  - `project` — project submissions (hackathon / portfolio projects)
 *
 * Everything a judge produces is described here, and nothing in the UI talks to
 * a table directly: the services normalise Supabase rows and the browser-local
 * store into these types, so the screens behave identically whether the judge is
 * signed in or working offline in guest mode.
 *
 * AI fields exist from day one but are never fabricated — `AiEvaluation` is
 * `unavailable` until a provider is registered (see services/judging/ai-evaluation.service).
